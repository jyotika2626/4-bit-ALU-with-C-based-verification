# 4-bit-ALU-with-C-based-verification


# Project Overview
This project implements a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog HDL and verifies its functionality using C-based verification.

The design and verification were simulated using EDA Playground.

# ⚙️ ALU Operations
| Opcode | Operation |

| 000 | Addition |
| 001 | Subtraction |
| 010 | AND |
| 011 | OR |
| 100 | XOR |
